# Hotel-Booking-Analysis-Dashboard
Project OverviewThis repository contains a comprehensive interactive dashboard for analyzing hotel booking patterns, revenue performance, and key operational metrics. The analysis provides deep insights into customer behavior, cancellation rates, lead times, and revenue generation across different customer types and countries, enabling data-driven strategic decisions for hotel management.Key FeaturesThe dashboard is designed to provide quick and actionable insights through several key visualizations and metrics:Metric/InsightDescriptionTotal Revenue & LossDisplays the sum of revenue generated and the total estimated revenue loss due to cancellations.Booking & Cancellation TrendAnalyzes the count of bookings and the breakdown of bookings that were Cancelled (1) versus Not Cancelled (0).Customer SegmentationBreaks down revenue, lead time, and distribution channel by Customer Type (e.g., Transient, Group, Contract).Geographic PerformanceIdentifies the Top Performing Countries by total revenue and total bookings.Lead Time AnalysisVisualizes the average lead time (days between booking and arrival) by customer type and its distribution across guests.Hotel Type BreakdownShows the distribution of bookings (Sum of Nights) across different Hotel Types (e.g., City vs. Resort).Deposit Type ImpactAnalyzes revenue based on the Deposit Type (e.g., No Deposit, Non-Refundable, Refundable).Data SourceThe dashboard utilizes a single, cleaned CSV file derived from a detailed hotel booking database.File Name: Hotel booking.xlsx - Sheet1.csvRows: Approximately 119K recordsKey Columns: Booking ID, Hotel, Arrival Date, Lead Time, Nights, Guests, Customer Type, Country, Cancelled (0/1), Revenue, and Revenue Loss.⚙️ Setup and Usage(This section is a placeholder.

Use the slicers and filters to drill down into specific segments of the data.Future EnhancementsIncorporate time intelligence to analyze Month-over-Month (MoM) or Year-over-Year (YoY) revenue growth.Develop a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a booking being cancelled.Add external holiday or events data to identify correlations with booking peaks.Create a drill-through page for individual booking detail lookup.AuthorDesign by Abdurrahman Uthman
